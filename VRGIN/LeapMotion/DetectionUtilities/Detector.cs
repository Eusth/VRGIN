   * Base class for detectors.
   * 
   * A Detector is an object that observes some aspect of a scene and reports true
   * when the specified conditions are met. Typically these conditions involve hand
   * information, but this is not required.
   * 
   * Detector implementations must call Activate() when their conditions are met and
   * Deactivate() when those conditions are no longer met. Implementations should
   * also call Deactivate() when they, or the object they are a component of become disabled.
   * Implementations can call Activate() and Deactivate() more often than is strictly necessary.
   * This Detector base class keeps track of the IsActive status and only dispatches events
   * when the status changes.
