# VRGIN
VR injection framework for Unity -- helps you integrate VR into games that don't natively support it.

## What it does
- It takes care of the cameras and the GUI
- It gives you a frame to work with (Controllers, Modes, etc.)
- It comes with presets for standing and seated mode, plus a set of tools for your controllers
- There is a bunch of helper classes, e.g. for shortcuts and for rumble

## What it doesn't do
- It does not take care of the injection into the DLL itself -- use either the Illusion Plugin Architecture or Rei Patcher for this.

## How to use it

Use [the template](https://github.com/Eusth/VRGIN.Template) to get started. For some (somewhat outdated) insight behind the scenes,  see [Hacking VR into a Unity game](https://github.com/Eusth/VRGIN/wiki/Hacking-VR-into-a-Unity-game). For examples, take a look at my VR mods.
